# MCP Picnic - AI-Powered Grocery Shopping Assistant

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@ivo-toby/mcp-picnic)](https://smithery.ai/server/@ivo-toby/mcp-picnic)

An intelligent Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to interact with Picnic, the online supermarket delivery service. This server transforms your AI assistant into a smart grocery shopping companion that can help you plan meals, manage your shopping cart, track deliveries, and optimize your grocery shopping experience.

## Recommended secure setup for Germany

For day-to-day use, run from an existing session and enable the registry-level safe mode. Do not put your Picnic password in the runtime MCP configuration:

```text
PICNIC_COUNTRY_CODE=DE
PICNIC_SESSION_FILE=/some/protected/path/picnic-session.json
PICNIC_SAFE_CART_ONLY=true
```

`PICNIC_SESSION_FILE` contains an authentication key that behaves like a bearer secret. Keep it outside the repository, exclude it from git, set its permissions to `0600`, and never paste its contents into prompts or chat. In safe/cart-only mode, the MCP registry exposes read operations and cart mutations, but does not register delivery-slot selection, delivery cancellation, recipe/account-side mutations, 2FA mutations, checkout, ordering, or payment mutations.

### One-time session bootstrap

1. Configure `PICNIC_COUNTRY_CODE=DE`, the protected `PICNIC_SESSION_FILE` path, and your username/password locally in your MCP client or a private `.env` file. Set `PICNIC_SAFE_CART_ONLY=false` temporarily because the 2FA tools are deliberately unavailable in safe mode. Do not provide the password, OTP, or auth key to Codex or another assistant.
2. Start the server. If Picnic requests 2FA, call `picnic_generate_2fa_code`, then enter the received OTP only into your trusted local MCP client for `picnic_verify_2fa_code`. The completed session is written to `PICNIC_SESSION_FILE`.
3. Stop the server, remove `PICNIC_USERNAME` and `PICNIC_PASSWORD` from the runtime configuration, protect the session with `chmod 600 /some/protected/path/picnic-session.json`, and restart with `PICNIC_SAFE_CART_ONLY=true`.
4. If the session expires, startup fails clearly without attempting a login. Repeat this local bootstrap process to replace it.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- A Picnic account (available in Netherlands, Germany, or France)
- An MCP-compatible AI assistant (Claude Desktop, Continue, etc.)
- Node.js 18+ installed on your system

### Quick Start

1. **Install the server**:

```bash
npm install -g mcp-picnic
```

2. **Configure Claude Desktop** to use the MCP server:

**macOS**: Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "picnic": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-picnic"],
      "env": {
        "PICNIC_USERNAME": "your-picnic-email@example.com",
        "PICNIC_PASSWORD": "your-picnic-password",
        "PICNIC_COUNTRY_CODE": "NL"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**:
- Replace `your-picnic-email@example.com` and `your-picnic-password` with your actual Picnic account credentials.
- Set `PICNIC_COUNTRY_CODE` to `"DE"` for Germany, `"FR"` for France, or `"NL"` for the Netherlands (default).

3. **Restart Claude Desktop** completely

4. **Complete 2FA** (if enabled on your account) - ask your MCP client/assistant to call the `picnic_generate_2fa_code` tool, then provide the received code so it can call `picnic_verify_2fa_code`. See the [Authentication](#authentication) section for details.

5. **Start using it** - you should see a 🔨 hammer icon in the input area:

```
"I want to plan meals for this week and order groceries from Picnic"
```

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Install from NPM (Recommended)

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g mcp-picnic

# Or install locally in your project
npm install mcp-picnic
```

### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ivo-toby/mcp-picnic.git
cd mcp-picnic

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Link globally (optional)
npm link
```

### Option 3: Docker / Docker Compose

```bash
# 1) Create .env with your Picnic credentials
cat > .env <<EOF
PICNIC_USERNAME=your-picnic-email@example.com
PICNIC_PASSWORD=your-picnic-password
PICNIC_COUNTRY_CODE=NL
EOF

# 2) Build and start
docker compose up -d --build

# 3) Check health
docker compose ps
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Notes:
- The container runs as a non-root user (UID `1638`).
- Session persistence is configured via volume `picnic-data` mapped to `/app/data`.
- `PICNIC_SESSION_FILE` defaults to `/app/data/picnic-session.json` in the container.
- `PICNIC_DEVICE_FILE` defaults to `/app/data/picnic-device.json` in the container, so a generated device id is persisted on the same volume and reused across restarts.

### Configuration

The server supports both stdio and HTTP transports:

**Stdio Transport (Default)**:

```bash
mcp-picnic
```

**HTTP Transport**:

```bash
mcp-picnic --enable-http --http-port 3000
```

### Environment Variables

You can configure the server using environment variables:

```bash
# Required: Picnic Account Credentials
PICNIC_USERNAME=your-picnic-email@example.com
PICNIC_PASSWORD=your-picnic-password

# Country Configuration (optional, defaults to NL)
# Set this to match your Picnic account's country
# Supported values: NL (Netherlands), DE (Germany), FR (France)
PICNIC_COUNTRY_CODE=NL

# HTTP Transport settings (optional)
ENABLE_HTTP_SERVER=true
HTTP_PORT=3000
# Default is localhost. Use 0.0.0.0 for Docker/external access.
HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0
# Optional: protect HTTP endpoints with a shared token
HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN=replace-with-a-long-random-token
# Optional: HTTP header name to accept token auth (default: x-mcp-token)
HTTP_AUTH_HEADER_NAME=x-mcp-token

# Session persistence (optional, strongly recommended in containers)
PICNIC_SESSION_FILE=~/.picnic-session.json

# Picnic API settings (optional)
PICNIC_API_VERSION=15

# Device identity sent to the Picnic API (optional)
# Defaults are provided by the picnic-api library; override these only if
# Picnic starts rejecting requests (e.g. 2FA codes not arriving) before the
# library ships updated defaults.
PICNIC_DEVICE_ID=3C417201548B2E3B
PICNIC_AGENT="30100;1.228.1-15480;"
```

#### Country Configuration

The `PICNIC_COUNTRY_CODE` setting determines which Picnic regional API to connect to. This **must match your Picnic account's country** for authentication to work correctly.

- **Default**: `NL` (Netherlands)
- **Supported values**:
  - `NL` - Netherlands (🇳🇱)
  - `DE` - Germany (🇩🇪)
  - `FR` - France (🇫🇷)

**When to set this:**
- If your Picnic account is registered in Germany, you **must** set `PICNIC_COUNTRY_CODE=DE`
- If your Picnic account is registered in France, you **must** set `PICNIC_COUNTRY_CODE=FR`
- If your Picnic account is in the Netherlands, you can omit this setting (defaults to `NL`)

**Example for German accounts:**
```bash
PICNIC_USERNAME=your-email@example.com
PICNIC_PASSWORD=your-password
PICNIC_COUNTRY_CODE=DE
```

#### HTTP Token Authentication

When `HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN` is set, all HTTP endpoints except `/health` require authentication. You can authenticate with either:

- Custom HTTP header token: `<HTTP_AUTH_HEADER_NAME>: YOUR_TOKEN` (defaults to `x-mcp-token`)
- Authorization header bearer token: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

Example requests:

```bash
curl -H "x-mcp-token: YOUR_TOKEN" "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" "http://localhost:3000/sessions"
```

If the token is missing or invalid, the server responds with `401 Unauthorized`.

### MCP Client Configuration

#### Claude Desktop

**Configuration File Locations:**

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "picnic": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-picnic"],
      "env": {
        "PICNIC_USERNAME": "your-picnic-email@example.com",
        "PICNIC_PASSWORD": "your-picnic-password",
        "PICNIC_COUNTRY_CODE": "NL"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**:
- Replace the placeholder credentials with your actual Picnic account details
- Set `PICNIC_COUNTRY_CODE` to `"DE"` for Germany, `"FR"` for France, or `"NL"` for the Netherlands (default)

**Setup Steps:**

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to Claude menu → Settings (not the in-app settings)
3. Click "Developer" in the left sidebar
4. Click "Edit Config" to open the configuration file
5. Add the configuration above
6. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop
7. Look for the 🔨 hammer icon in the input area

#### Continue (VS Code)

Add to your Continue configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": [
    {
      "name": "picnic",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-picnic"],
      "env": {
        "PICNIC_USERNAME": "your-picnic-email@example.com",
        "PICNIC_PASSWORD": "your-picnic-password",
        "PICNIC_COUNTRY_CODE": "NL"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: Set `PICNIC_COUNTRY_CODE` to `"DE"` for Germany or `"FR"` for France. Netherlands accounts can omit this field (defaults to `"NL"`).

## Authentication

The server uses the credentials configured in your environment variables:

1. **Required**: Set `PICNIC_USERNAME` and `PICNIC_PASSWORD` in your MCP configuration
2. **Session Persistence**: After successful authentication, your session is saved to `~/.picnic-session.json` and reused across restarts. You can customize this path with the `PICNIC_SESSION_FILE` environment variable.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

If your Picnic account has 2FA enabled, complete the verification flow using MCP tools:

1. Call `picnic_generate_2fa_code` to send a verification code (usually SMS).
2. Call `picnic_verify_2fa_code` with the received OTP code.

> Important: In Docker, the server itself cannot "chat" or type the code for you. Your MCP client (Claude Desktop, Continue, etc.) must trigger these tools.

To avoid repeated 2FA challenges and container restart loops, persist `PICNIC_SESSION_FILE` to a Docker volume.
When 2FA is pending, the server stays up so your client can complete `picnic_generate_2fa_code` and `picnic_verify_2fa_code`.

**Security Note**: Credentials are used only for Picnic API authentication. The session token is stored locally at `PICNIC_SESSION_FILE`; the password is never stored on disk.

## Available Tools

The server provides comprehensive access to Picnic's functionality through 30+ specialized tools:

### Authentication & Account Management

- **`picnic_generate_2fa_code`** - Generate 2FA verification code (SMS/other channels)
- **`picnic_verify_2fa_code`** - Verify 2FA code for authentication
- **`picnic_get_user_details`** - Get current user profile information
- **`picnic_get_user_info`** - Get user information including feature toggles

**Note**: Authentication is handled automatically using credentials from environment variables (`PICNIC_USERNAME` and `PICNIC_PASSWORD`). No manual login is required.

### Product Discovery & Search

- **`picnic_search`** - Search for products by name or keywords
- **`picnic_get_promotions`** - Get current weekly promotions/deals with prices and labels
- **`picnic_get_suggestions`** - Get product suggestions based on query
- **`picnic_get_product_details`** - Get detailed information about a specific product
- **`picnic_get_image`** - Get product images in various sizes (tiny to extra-large)

```
"Ik wil maaltijden plannen voor deze week en boodschappen bestellen bij Picnic"
```

## Setup Instructies

### Optie 1: Installeer van NPM (Aanbevolen)

```bash
# Installeer globaal
npm install -g mcp-picnic

# Of installeer lokaal in je project
npm install mcp-picnic
```

### Optie 2: Bouw van Bron

```bash
# Kloon de repository
git clone https://github.com/ivo-toby/mcp-picnic.git
cd mcp-picnic

# Installeer dependencies
npm install

# Bouw het project
npm run build

# Link globaal (optioneel)
npm link
```

## Authenticatie

De server gebruikt de inloggegevens die geconfigureerd zijn in je omgevingsvariabelen:

1. **Vereist**: Stel `PICNIC_USERNAME` en `PICNIC_PASSWORD` in je MCP configuratie in
2. **Sessie opslag**: Na succesvolle authenticatie wordt je sessie opgeslagen in `~/.picnic-session.json` en hergebruikt bij herstarts. Je kunt dit pad aanpassen met de `PICNIC_SESSION_FILE` omgevingsvariabele.

### Tweefactorauthenticatie (2FA)

Als je Picnic-account 2FA heeft ingeschakeld, moet je de verificatie voltooien voordat je de winkeltools kunt gebruiken. Vraag bij je eerste gesprek na het starten van de server aan de AI-assistent om:

1. **Een 2FA-code te genereren**: De assistent roept `picnic_generate_2fa_code` aan om een verificatiecode via SMS naar je telefoon te sturen
2. **De code in te voeren**: Vertel de assistent de code die je hebt ontvangen, en deze roept `picnic_verify_2fa_code` aan om de authenticatie te voltooien

Zodra 2FA is geverifieerd, wordt je sessie opgeslagen en hoef je deze stap niet te herhalen totdat de sessie verloopt.

**Voorbeeld**:
```
Gebruiker: "Ik moet mijn Picnic account verifiëren"
AI: Ik genereer een 2FA-code voor je... Er is een code naar je telefoon gestuurd via SMS.
Gebruiker: "De code is 123456"
AI: Je 2FA-code is geverifieerd. Je bent nu volledig geauthenticeerd en kunt beginnen met winkelen!
```

**Beveiligingsnotitie**: Je inloggegevens worden alleen gebruikt om te authenticeren met Picnic's API. Het sessietoken wordt lokaal opgeslagen in `~/.picnic-session.json`. Je wachtwoord wordt nooit op schijf opgeslagen.

## Wie zu Verwenden

### Voraussetzungen

- Ein Picnic-Konto (verfügbar in den Niederlanden oder Deutschland)
- Ein MCP-kompatibler KI-Assistent (Claude Desktop, Continue, etc.)
- Node.js 18+ auf Ihrem System installiert

### Schnellstart

1. **Installieren Sie den Server**:

```bash
npm install -g mcp-picnic
```

2. **Konfigurieren Sie Claude Desktop**, um den MCP-Server zu verwenden:

**macOS**: Bearbeiten Sie `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: Bearbeiten Sie `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Fügen Sie diese Konfiguration hinzu:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "picnic": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-picnic"],
      "env": {
        "PICNIC_USERNAME": "ihre-picnic-email@example.com",
        "PICNIC_PASSWORD": "ihr-picnic-passwort",
        "PICNIC_COUNTRY_CODE": "DE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Wichtig**:
- Ersetzen Sie `ihre-picnic-email@example.com` und `ihr-picnic-passwort` mit Ihren tatsächlichen Picnic-Kontodaten.
- Für deutsche Accounts sollte `PICNIC_COUNTRY_CODE` auf `"DE"` gesetzt sein. Für niederländische Accounts setzen Sie es auf `"NL"`.

3. **Starten Sie Claude Desktop** vollständig neu

4. **Beginnen Sie mit der Nutzung** - Sie sollten ein 🔨 Hammer-Symbol im Eingabebereich sehen:

```
"Ich möchte Mahlzeiten für diese Woche planen und Lebensmittel bei Picnic bestellen"
```

## Setup-Anweisungen

### Option 1: Von NPM installieren (Empfohlen)

```bash
# Global installieren
npm install -g mcp-picnic

# Oder lokal in Ihrem Projekt installieren
npm install mcp-picnic
```

### Option 2: Aus Quelle erstellen

```bash
# Repository klonen
git clone https://github.com/ivo-toby/mcp-picnic.git
cd mcp-picnic

# Abhängigkeiten installieren
npm install

# Projekt erstellen
npm run build

# Global verknüpfen (optional)
npm link
```

## Authentifizierung

Der Server verwendet die in Ihren Umgebungsvariablen konfigurierten Anmeldedaten:

1. **Erforderlich**: Setzen Sie `PICNIC_USERNAME` und `PICNIC_PASSWORD` in Ihrer MCP-Konfiguration
2. **Sitzungsspeicherung**: Nach erfolgreicher Authentifizierung wird Ihre Sitzung in `~/.picnic-session.json` gespeichert und bei Neustarts wiederverwendet. Sie können diesen Pfad mit der Umgebungsvariablen `PICNIC_SESSION_FILE` anpassen.

### Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung (2FA)

Wenn Ihr Picnic-Konto 2FA aktiviert hat, müssen Sie die Verifizierung abschließen, bevor Sie die Einkaufs-Tools verwenden können. Bitten Sie bei Ihrem ersten Gespräch nach dem Start des Servers den KI-Assistenten:

1. **Einen 2FA-Code zu generieren**: Der Assistent ruft `picnic_generate_2fa_code` auf, um einen Verifizierungscode per SMS an Ihr Telefon zu senden
2. **Den Code einzugeben**: Teilen Sie dem Assistenten den erhaltenen Code mit, und er ruft `picnic_verify_2fa_code` auf, um die Authentifizierung abzuschließen

Sobald die 2FA verifiziert ist, wird Ihre Sitzung gespeichert und Sie müssen diesen Schritt nicht wiederholen, bis die Sitzung abläuft.

**Beispiel**:
```
Benutzer: "Ich muss mein Picnic-Konto verifizieren"
KI: Ich generiere einen 2FA-Code für Sie... Ein Code wurde per SMS an Ihr Telefon gesendet.
Benutzer: "Der Code ist 123456"
KI: Ihr 2FA-Code wurde verifiziert. Sie sind jetzt vollständig authentifiziert und können mit dem Einkaufen beginnen!
```

**Sicherheitshinweis**: Ihre Anmeldedaten werden nur zur Authentifizierung mit Picnics API verwendet. Das Sitzungstoken wird lokal unter `~/.picnic-session.json` gespeichert. Ihr Passwort wird niemals auf der Festplatte gespeichert.
